# TensorFlow-Object-Detection-Project

This project was completed for Eduhacks 2017. My project group and I decided to use the TensorFlow machine learning python library to 
detect objects in a computer's webcam, translate the name of the objects into a user decided language, and test the user to see if they
can correctly identify the name of the object in the translated language. The original complete project involving an extrememly basic 
UI (this was completed in 24 hours) can be found on my **project partners repo** https://github.com/SinaKhalili/LinguaLook

**Project was completed following this tutorial https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-use-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/**

**This repo** contains the basic object detection python script which I wrote (through the guidance of an online tutorial) to utilize the webcam to identify objects and label them in english. This also contains the relevant TensorFlow files to run the program as well as example screenshots of the object detection program working.

**to run the script**
- *run.py* is the source code (found in the object_detection folder, or copied as *run_copy.py*)
- for windows machines, python 3.5.2 64bit is required as well as TensorFlow of course 
- pillow, lxml, jupyter, matplotlib, and opencv were downloaded 
- protoc 3.4.0-win32 downloaded, extracted, and run in the object detection folder
